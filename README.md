# ZOOtopia Zoo Management Application

## Overview
Welcome to ZOOtopia! This application is designed to manage a zoo, allowing admins to manage attractions, animals, events, discounts, and visitor information. Visitors can explore the zoo, buy memberships, purchase tickets, visit animals and attractions, and leave feedback. The application demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as interfaces, inheritance, abstract classes, and polymorphism.

## Assumptions

1. I have hard-coded the 6 minimum animals that were needed.
2. The name for each animal is different, I have assumed that.
3. The number of visitors determines the popularity of the attraction.
4. When the user enters the number of tickets, like if he enters 3 tickets, then I will apply the best special deal he has, even if there exists a case where his money remains less to buy all the 3 tickets.
5. If a user has a basic membership, then If he is going to buy a premium membership, then I am charging him 50 rupees (not 30).
6. If a user has a ticket for an attraction and then again buys an attraction, then the visitor will have 2 tickets for the same attraction, meaning he can visit that attraction 2 times.
7. The id of attraction starts from 0.
8. All the attractions are closed initially whenever the user adds a new attraction.
9. The phone number entered should be 10 digits, and in email also it should contain both @ and . and at least 2 letters after.
10. If a user has a premium membership, then he cannot buy a basic membership again.
11. If the user enters the wrong discount code, then he will not get the student/senior citizen discount, and if he enters the right code then he will get a discount on both membership and buy tickets.
